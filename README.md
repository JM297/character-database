# character-database

(This README.md is a work in progress)

This is a MERN stack project (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js). The purpose is to be a database for a comic book writer or artist's characters for ease of access.

# Server
Server is where the logic is stored for connecting to the user's database and the structure of the character schema.

# Client
Client is the UI/UX section of the project. This is what the user's going to see.
